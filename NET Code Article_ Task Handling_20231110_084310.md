## Introduction

This article demonstrates how to enhance the processing of a list of tasks in .NET, focusing on robust error handling, telemetry, and flexible result management. The code and patterns discussed here are part of the [TaskListProcessor](https://github.com/MarkHazleton/TaskListProcessor) project.

---

## TaskListProcessor Class

```csharp
// ...existing code for TaskListProcessor...
```

### Key Features

- **Waits for all provided tasks to complete** and logs errors if any fail.
- **Captures telemetry** for performance monitoring.
- **Handles exceptions gracefully** and logs them for analysis.
- **Supports flexible result types** for heterogeneous task lists.

---

## Example: WeatherService

```csharp
// ...existing code for WeatherService and WeatherForecast...
```

---

## Console Application Example

```csharp
// ...existing code for using TaskListProcessor and WeatherService in a console app...
```

### Enhancing Task.WhenAll with WhenAllWithLoggingAsync

- Adds centralized error logging using `ILogger`.
- Prevents application crashes from unhandled exceptions.
- Simplifies calling code by removing the need for repetitive try-catch blocks.
- Integrates with monitoring tools for production readiness.

### Improving Async Calls with GetTaskResultAsync

- Adds telemetry using `Stopwatch` for performance insights.
- Robust error handling and logging for each task.
- Execution isolation: one task's failure does not affect others.
- Flexible result typing using generics, allowing different result types in a single list.
- Aggregates results in a structured format for easy processing.
